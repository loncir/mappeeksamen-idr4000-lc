    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nReliability is essential in both research and sports performance testing as it ensures consistent and accurate results over time. When a test is highly reliable, we can trust its findings and be confident that the experiment can be reproduced with similar outcomes. Moreover, high reliability allows researchers and coaches to track athletes’ progress effectively, making sure that changes in performance are due to actual improvements rather than measurement errors.Without reliable measurements and data, it becomes difficult to draw meaningful conclusions or develop effective training programs.\nThe purpose of this report is to present estimates of reliability of measures collected from multiple VO2max tests. The VO2max test is often seen as the benchmark for assessing a person’s aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness as it measures the maximum oxygen volume a person can use during intense exercise. The test is therefore widely used in both clinical and sports settings as it is an important marker for endurance. On the other hand, its reliability can be affected by several factors, including the testing protocol, equipment calibration, participant motivation, and environmental conditions. Understanding these factors is critical for interpreting the results accurately and applying them effectively in training and research settings.\nThe VO2max tests in our research project were performed in the physiology lab at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences and we used Rstudio to analyze the data and to estimate if the performed tests were reliable.",

    "section": "1.2 Method",
    "text": "1.2 Method\nWe performed a test-retest in our study where we gathered data from multiple VO2max tests. 16 subjects performed two till four tests in the time span of 3 weeks. The first two tests were performed within 24 hours of each other during the first week. The last two tests were performed within 48 hours of each other during the third week.\n\n1.2.1 Standardization pre-test\nThe results of a VO2max test are influenced by a various of physiological and environmental factors, it is therefore important to set certain rules that the subject must follow in the days leading up to the test. A guideline may be sent out to the subject a couple of days before their first test with information regarding how they should prepare for test day. This guideline should include standardization practices that helps isolate the true aerobic performance of the subject and eliminates external factors that could influence the test results. Biological factors that are controlled for are exercise, hydration, sleeping schedule, caffeine and caloric intake, alcohol consumption and the time of day the test is performed. The subject then must follow the same schedule leading up to their next test to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and comparability of the test results.\n\n\n1.2.2 Equipment\nSpecific equipment is needed to perform a VO2max test. We had the subject perform the test on a cycle ergometer. This is a stationary bike that allows for incremental increases in resistance (W) during the test to progressively challenge the subject’s aerobic capacity. We also used a system called Vyntus which measures the volume of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced during the test. It has an automated software that helps us collect and analyze the data. There is also an integrated on-board pulse oximeter and automated volume and gas calibration. The subject had to wear a heart rate monitor attached to a chest strap in addition to a mouthpiece and a nose clip. The mouthpiece is connected by a hose to the mixing chamber that collects exhaled air that is analyzed by Vyntus. To measure the subject’s lactate, we used a machine called Biosen which analyzes the blood and provides lactate values. Lastly, we had a stopwatch, an additional computer for our excel spread sheet and a scale to measure the subjects weight before starting the test. The whole setup allows us to monitor and measure the needed data to determine the subject’s VO2max as it gives us accurate information of the subject’s oxygen consumption, heart rate, and cycling power output.\n\n\n1.2.3 Protocol\nThe test protocol for performing a VO2.max test tells us how the test should be performed each time as standardization is important to get accurate and reliable results. A subject should therefore have the same test leader if a test is repeated. During our tests we adhered to the following protocol where a spread sheet in excel is prepared by the test leader before coming to the lab. When arriving, the test leader puts on a lab coat and ensures that Biosen (lactate measurement) is turned on. The machine then needs to be calibrated, and the results should come out to be 12 mmol/la. In the event of a calibration error, meaning that the instrument may provide inaccurate data, the standard fluid gets changed. Vyntus then needs to be calibrated by gas calibration and volume calibration. Gas calibration must be within 2.0 diff. and the volume calibration must be within 0.2 diff. Here the gas container needs to be opened, and the ventilation volume transducer (Triple-V turbine) must be attached to Vyntus. While the calibrations are in progress, the test leader puts together the mouthpiece, along with the nose clip, and attaches it with a hose to the mixing chamber. Then the cycle ergometer needs to be calibrated by positioning the crank arm straight up. This calibration is done on the computer connected to the ergometer as we use a different program here than Vyntus. The crank arm is looked at to make sure that it is 172.5 mm long and that the correct pedal type is attached. Lastly the equipment to measure lactate is collected and everything is ready for the subjects arrival.\nA participant profile must be created in both Vyntus and the ergometer program. The profile includes the subjects name, date of birth, gender, height and weight. The first thing we do when the subject arrives is to measure weight, here the weight shown on the scale is subtracted by 300g. The cycling ergometer is then adjusted so that the subject is sitting comfortably on the bike. The bike settings are then saved in the cycling program to be used for future tests. Now the subject is ready for warm-up. The warm-up is 5 minutes long where the subject should have a progressively increase on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale from 10 to 13. If the subject wants, the fan is turned on and faced towards them. The test leader then proceeds to inform about the test and Borg scale. Vyntus is then set to “measurement” and test leader makes sure that the heart rate monitor is connected to Vyntus, as well as making sure that the settings are set to 30 seconds measurements and size medium for the mouthpiece. The gas container gets closed, and Triple-V is disconnected from Vyntus and attached to the mixing chamber. Warm up is finished and the test gets started in Vyntus. The actual test starts when 1 minute has pasted in Vyntus and the VO2.max protocol starts on the cycling program. A stopwatch is also started and gets placed in front of the subject.\nThroughout the test, the test leader informs about increases in resistance (W), normally 20W increases for women and 25W for men, and pushes the subject to pedal until exhaustion. The test stops when the subject gives up or the RPM drops below 60. The test leader writes down the maximum heart rate, end time, end wattage and borg score at the end of test in the excel spread sheet. Lactate is taken one minute after the test ends by wiping off the finger of the subject, poke a whole, wiping off the first drop of blood and then filling up the tube. The blood is then analyzed in Biosen. The subject is done testing and may leave, while test leader ends the test in both Vyntus and the cycling program. The bike, mouthpiece, hose and heart rate monitor get washed and the fan is faced towards the mixing chamber to let it dry.\n\n\n1.2.4 Post-test data preparation\nCorrectly gathering the data from the test is critical as it gives us insight into the subject’s aerobic capacity and overall cardiovascular fitness. The report generated by Vyntus is saved onto a memory stick so it can later be saved to OneDrive. The excel spread sheet is then filled with values from the report. These values include absolute VO2max (vo2.max) expressed in milliliters of oxygen per minute (ml/min), giving us the total oxygen consumption of the subject which is needed for assessing overall capacity. The maximum volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced (vco2.max) which tells us how much CO2 is being expelled by the subject’s body during the test. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) which is used to estimate the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen (O2) consumed during metabolism. The maximum minute ventilation (VE.max) which is the highest volume of air the subject can move in and out of their lungs per minute. The breathing frequency maximum (BF.max) which is the maximum number of breaths per minute the subject takes at peak exercise intensity. Lastly, the lactate measurements are gathered from the Biosen machine. Maximum heart rate, end time, end wattage and borg score are already filled out from end of test while ID, period, timepoint, date, time of day, temperature, humidity, sex, age, height and weight was filled out pre-test. We then got the data from the other groups and collected it all in one excel sheet. The data was then exported into RStudio where we further analyzed our results.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nResistance training is a general term referring to exercise requiring one to exert force against a resistance (Kraemer et al. 2017). By using resistance, whether from weights or body weight, resistance training helps improve muscle strength, endurance, and power. This way of training have become a fundamental element in fitness and rehabilitation due to its variety of health benefits, as it enhances physical performance and improves overall quality of life. Such benefits are valuable across many fields, from sports to general health and longevity. Investigating the effects of resistance training is therefore crucial for understanding how to best utilize its extensive health benefits. Different variables in resistance training, such as volume, may affect the outcome, making it essential to examine how specific training protocols contribute to muscular strength and body composition.\nResistance training volume refers to the total amount of work performed in a single resistance training session or across multiple sessions. Volume is a crucial variable in resistance training as it influences the training adaptions, such as muscle growth, lean body mass and muscle strength. Muscle growth, or hypertrophy, involves an increase in the number of muscle fibers and thus increased muscular size (Kraemer et al. 2017) while lean body mass refers to the total body mass without the weight of body fat. Muscle hypertrophy is one component of lean mass gain as gains in lean mass are often attributed to hypertrophy. Muscle strength refers to the maximum force or tension that a muscle or group of muscles can generate during a single maximal effort and is influenced by factors such as hypertrophy (KRAEMER and RATAMESS 2004). Finding the right volume balance is essential as different volumes may lead to different results. Some authors have claimed that multiple sets are necessary to optimize strength gains, while others have argued that a single set per exercise is all that is necessary, and further gains are not achieved by successive sets (Krieger 2009). Ostrowski et al. investigated the impact of different volumes of resistance training on muscle size and function over a 10-week period and found that regardless of the volume of training, all groups experienced increases in muscle size and strength (Ostrowski et al. 1997). These findings are supported by Cannon & Marino as their findings demonstrate that additional neuromuscular adaption during early-phase moderate-intensity resistance training may not be elicited through higher-volume training when training loads are matched provided that a minimal volume threshold is attained (Cannon and Marino 2010). However, evidence from several other studies supports greater strength gains with multiple sets. One of the most notable scientific studies was performed in the early 1960s and found that different training volumes and intensities elicit different magnitudes of strength gains as three sets of six repetitions resulted in the greatest strength increases (RHEA et al. 2003) & (Berger 1962)). A more recent study, done by Humburg et al., support these findings as they argue that improvements for 1RM is significantly higher during a 3-set program compared to a 1-set program (Humburg et al. 2007).\nAs a result, there has been considerable debate over the optimal number of sets per exercise to improve musculoskeletal strength during a resistance exercise program [krieger2009]. Additionally, much research has been performed examining strength increases with training, but they provide little insight into the magnitude of strength gains along the continuum of training volume (RHEA et al. 2003). Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify the effect of single- and multiple-set programs on lean body mass and maximal strength by using a within-participant study design.",

To be eligible for the study one had to meat specific health criteria and be a non-smoker. People were excluded if they had any sensitivity to local anesthetics, had participated in resistance training more than once a week in the previous year, had limitations in muscle strength due to injury, or were taking medications that could interfere with training outcomes(Hammarström et al. 2020). Participants are further described in Table 3.1.

Data are means and standard deviations (SD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Study overview\nThe 12-week training intervention consisted of full-body resistance exercises. Leg exercises were done one leg at a time, allowing for the comparison of different training volumes and its effect on each participant. One leg was randomly assigned to perform a single set of each exercise, while the other leg performed three sets. This allowed each participant to engage in both workout protocols. Muscle strength was evaluated at the beginning of the intervention (pre), and at the end of the 12 weeks (post). Body composition, including measurements of hypertrophy and lean mass gain, were taken at the start and conclusion of the study.\n\n3.2.2.1 Training protocol\nParticipants completed a standardized warm-up before each workout. The warm-up included cycling on an ergometer for 5 minutes with a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) score of 12-14 as the intensity should be moderate. Secondly, they did bodyweight exercises such as back extensions, push-ups and squats for 10 repetitions. Lastly, participants performed one set of 10 reps at 50% of their one-repetition maximum (1RM) for each exercise. Leg resistance exercises were performed as either one set (single) or three sets (multiple), with the single set completed between the second and third set in the multiple-set routine. Exercises were performed in order with unilateral leg press first, then leg curl and lastly knee extension. Rest intervals between the sets ranged from 90 to 180 seconds. The training intensity gradually increased over the course of the intervention. The participants started with 10RM for the first two weeks, then 8RM for the following three weeks, and lastly 7RM for the remaining seven weeks. One session a week with reduced loads (90%) were introduced from the ninth session. High-intensity training sessions were spaced at least 48 hours apart, while sessions with reduced loads were scheduled at least 24 hours apart from other sessions.\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Maximal strength and lean mass assessments\nMaximal strength for unilateral leg press was evaluated using the one-repetition maximum (1RM) method. 1RM was found by progressively increasing the weight until the participant could no longer complete a full range of motion. The successful lift with the highest load was recorded as the 1RM. Lean mass (and hypertrophy) was measured regionally and determined before and after the training intervention using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI specifically determined the knee-extensor muscle cross-sectional area (CSA; vastus lateralis, medialis, intermedius and rectus femoris).\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Data analysis\nIn this study, we used a paired t-test to compare the pre- and post-intervention measurements between single and multiple sets for each participant.",

    "text": "3.4 Discussion\nThe paired t-test results for the lean mass and maximal strength data indicate that the difference in change between the single-set and multiple-set conditions was statistically significant, with a mean difference of 122.8 (95% CI: [8.6, 237.0], p-value = 0.036, t33 = 2.19) and 6.8 (95% CI: [0.7, 12.9], p-value = 0.031, t30 = 2.26) respectively. The p-value of 0.036 and 0.031 suggests that this result is unlikely to be due to random chance, as it falls below the significance threshold of 0.05. Furthermore, the 95% confidence interval (CI) demonstrates that the true mean difference in regional lean body mass gain lies between 8.6 grams and 237.0 grams, while the true mean difference in strength lies between 0.7 kilograms and 12.9 kilograms. These findings suggest that the observed effect is consistent and meaningful, but also highlighting some variability across participants.\nOverall, the results indicate that both training volumes were effective in improving muscle function, with increased gains in lean body mass and maximal strength. Improvements from pre- to post-intervention where on average higher for the leg performing multiple sets of the exercise compared to the leg who did a single set. Both male and female participants demonstrated similar patterns of improvement, however, males experienced greater gains in lean mass with multiple sets, while females showed more pronounced increases in maximal strength. All in all, these findings suggest that a moderate-volume training regimen is more effective than a low-volume regimen in enhancing lean mass and maximal strength in both men and women.\nOur findings align with a growing body of research that indicates higher training volumes generally lead to more significant improvements in both lean mass and muscle strength. Rhea et al. (RHEA et al. 2003), similarly reported that multiple sets resulted in superior strength gains compared to single sets. Additionally, research by Krieger (Berger 1962) and Humburg et al. (Humburg et al. 2007) suggests that training volume plays a significant role in optimizing strength outcomes, particularly with multi-set protocols. On the other hand, it is worth nothing that regardless of training volume, we saw that on average both sexes exhibited increases in muscle size and strength. These findings align with Ostrowski’s notion that resistance training is beneficial across various volumes (Ostrowski et al. 1997). However, our results challenge his conclusion that there are no significant differences between different training volumes, suggesting that a higher volume of training may play a more significant role in optimizing muscle growth and strength development. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the improvement in lean mass was more pronounced in male participants, whereas females showed more significant strength gains. These findings may align with those of Cannon and Marino who suggested that training volume and intensity have different impacts depending on the individual’s training status and the specific adaptions targeted (Cannon and Marino 2010).",

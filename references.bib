               a variety of fast and slow fiber types and subtypes. Moreover,
               muscle fibers are versatile entities capable of adjusting their
               phenotypic properties in response to altered functional demands.
               Major differences between muscle fiber types relate to their
               myosin complement, i.e., isoforms of myosin light and heavy
               chains. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms appear to represent
               the most appropriate markers for fiber type delineation. On this
               basis, pure fiber types are characterized by the expression of a
               single MHC isoform, whereas hybrid fiber type express two or
               more MHC isoforms. Hybrid fibers bridge the gap between the pure
               fiber types. The fiber population of skeletal muscles, thus,
               encompasses a continuum of pure and hybrid fiber types. Under
               certain conditions, changes can be induced in MHC isoform
               expression heading in the direction of either fast-to-slow or
               slow-to-fast. Increased neuromuscular activity, mechanical
               loading, and hypothyroidism are conditions that induce
               fast-to-slow transitions, whereas reduced neuromuscular
               activity, mechanical unloading, and hyperthyroidism cause

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Menstrual irregularity (MI) is common in female
               athletes and is a component of the Female Athlete Triad (Triad).
               Many athletes with the Triad are started on hormonal
               contraceptives (HC) for MI, but this interferes with the ability
               to monitor menstrual cycle regularity and can mask other causes
               of MI. There are limited studies investigating the relationship
               between MI, HC use, and injury in female collegiate athletes.
               OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of and relationship between
               HC use, MI, and bone stress injuries in female collegiate
               athletes in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
               SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: 1020 U.S. female
               collegiate athletes (age $\geq$ 18 years). METHODS OR
               INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of risk factors for menstrual
               irregularity and bone stress injuries was conducted via a
               one-time survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HC use, MI, history of
               stress fractures. RESULTS: Current HC use prevalence was 65\%
               (95\% confidence interval [CI], 61.9\%, 67.8\%). Of all
               athletes, 47\% reported past MI. Of the athletes who were not
               currently using HCs, 32\% had current MI. Compared with athletes
               without past MI, more athletes with past MI reported current HC
               use (73\% vs. 57\%) and indicated menstrual cycle consistency as
               the primary reason for use (24\% vs. 4\%) (P < .001).
               Additionally, 25\% of athletes reported a history of stress
               fractures, which was associated with lean/aesthetic sports
               participation (odds ratio [95\% CI]: 1.9 [1.4, 2.5]; P < .001)
               and less oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use (0.7 [0.5, 1.0]; P =
               .043). Compared with OCPs, injectable HCs were associated with
               greater odds of a history of stress fractures (4.5[1.6, 12.3]; P
               = .004). CONCLUSIONS: HC use was prevalent among this cohort of
               female collegiate athletes, and almost half of the athletes
               reported past MI. A goal of menstrual cycle regularity was cited
               by 24\% of athletes as a primary reason to use HCs, which shows
               that more athlete education is needed to avoid masking MI and
               the Triad with HCs. Further studies elucidating the relationship
               between HC use, MI, and sports-related injury are warranted.",

              and mid-luteal phase (group 1, 2, 3, 4). In each phase of the

               prevalence in oligoamenorrheic athletes (AA), eumenorrheic
               athletes (EA), and nonathletes (NA) and determine relationships
               with bone density, structure, and strength estimates. METHODS:
               One hundred seventy-five females (100 AA, 35 EA, and 40 NA)
               14-25 yr old were studied. Lifetime fracture history was
               obtained through participant interviews. Areal bone mineral
               density (BMD) was assessed by DXA at the spine, hip, and whole
               body (WB). Bone structure was assessed by HRpQCT at the radius
               and tibia, and strength by finite element analysis. RESULTS: AA,
               EA, and NA did not differ in age, sexual maturity, or height. AA
               had lower BMI, and older menarchal age than EA and NA (P $\leq$
               0.001). Bone mineral density Z-scores were lower in AA versus EA
               at the total hip, femoral neck, spine, and whole body (P $\leq$
               0.001). Lifetime fracture risk was higher in AA than EA and NA
               (47\%, 25.7\%, 12.5\%; P $\leq$ 0.001), largely driven by stress
               fractures in AA versus EA and NA (32\% vs 5.9\% vs 0\%). In AA,
               those who fractured had lower lumbar and WB BMD Z-scores,
               volumetric BMD (vBMD) of outer trabecular region in radius and
               tibia, and trabecular thickness of the radius (P $\leq$ 0.05).
               In AA, those who had two or more stress fractures had lower
               lumbar and WB BMD Z-scores, total cross-sectional area,
               trabecular vBMD, stiffness, and failure load at radius; and
               lower stiffness and failure load at tibia versus those with
               fewer than two stress fractures (P $\leq$ 0.05). CONCLUSION:
               Weight-bearing athletic activity increases BMD but may increase
               stress fracture risk in those with menstrual dysfunction. Bone
               microarchitecture and strength differences are more pronounced
               in AA with multiple stress fractures. This is the first study to
               examine fractures in relation to bone structure in adolescent
               female athletes.",

              and extended menstrual cycle length influence the incidence of
              injuries in international footballers. Methods: Over a 4-year
              period, injuries from England international footballers at
              training camps or matches were recorded, alongside self-reported
              information on menstrual cycle characteristics at the point of
              injury. Injuries in eumenorrheic players were categorized into
              early follicular, late follicular, or luteal phase. Frequencies
              were also compared between injuries recorded during the typical
              cycle and those that occurred after the cycle would be expected
              to have finished. Injury incidence rates (per 1,000 person days)
              and injury incidence rate ratios were calculated for each phase
              for all injuries and injuries stratified by type. Results: One
              hundred fifty-six injuries from 113 players were eligible for
              analysis. Injury incidence rates per 1,000 person-days were 31.9
              in the follicular, 46.8 in the late follicular, and 35.4 in the

              muscle and tendon injury rates were 88\% greater in the late
              follicular phase compared to the follicular phase, with muscle
              rupture/tear/strain/cramps and tendon injuries/ruptures occurring
              over twice as often during the late follicular phase compared to
              other phases 20\% of injuries were reported as occurring when

              injuries occurred almost twice as often in the late follicular
              phase compared to the early follicular or luteal phase. Injury

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: The female athlete triad describes the interrelatedness
               of energy availability, menstrual function, and bone density.
               Although associations between triad components and
               musculoskeletal injury (INJ) have been reported in collegiate
               athletes, limited information exists about menstrual
               irregularity (MI) and INJ in the high school population.
               OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and relationship
               between MI and INJ in high school athletes. DESIGN:
               Cross-sectional study. SETTING: High schools. PATIENTS OR OTHER
               PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 249 female athletes from 3
               high schools who competed in 33 interscholastic,
               school-sponsored sport teams, dance teams, and cheerleading or
               pom-pon squad during the 2006-2007 school year. Each athlete
               remained on the roster throughout the season. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURE(S): Participants completed a survey regarding injury
               type, number of days of sport participation missed, and
               menstrual history in the past year. RESULTS: The prevalences of
               M I and INJ were 19.7\% and 63.1 \%, respectively. Athletes who
               reported MI sustained a higher percentage of severe injuries
               (missing $\geq$ 22 days of practice or competition) than did
               athletes who reported normal menses. Although the trend was not
               significant, athletes with MI were almost 3 times more likely to
               sustain an injury resulting in 7 or more days of time lost from
               sport (odds ratio = 2.7, 95\% confidence interval = 0.8, 8.8)
               than those who sustained an injury resulting in 7 or fewer days
               of time lost. CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of MI and INJ in this
               high school population during the study period were high.
               Athletes who reported MI sustained a higher percentage of severe
               injuries than did athletes who reported normal menses. Education
               programs to increase knowledge and improve management of MI and
               its potential effects on injury in female high school athletes
               are warranted.",

              total load but differing in training plan progression, on
              endurance adaptations. METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen
              uptake (V˙O2peak) 61.3 $\pm$ 5.8 mL·kg·min) were randomized to
              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training
              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of
              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing
              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\times$ 16
              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\times$ 4
              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed
              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the
              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed
              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all
              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session
              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol·L

              response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large,
              moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
              training group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk
              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation

              cross-sectional area (~+300 $\mu$m2). When examining the effects
              of training on LBM increases ($\Delta$LBM) in all participants
              combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p < 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85
              kg, p < 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting
              $\Delta$LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to
              remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was
              observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p < 0.001) but not MID to
              POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP
              supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body
              composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases
              observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP
              supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program,
              ECW-corrected $\Delta$LBM gains were largely dampened, but still
              positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded ~20
              sets/exercise/wk.",

               biomarkers between previously-trained low versus high
               hypertrophic responders in response to resistance training.
               Herein, 30 college-aged males (training age 5 $\pm$ 3 years;
               mean $\pm$ SD) partook in 6 weeks of high-volume resistance
               training. Body composition, right leg vastus lateralis (VL)
               biopsies, and blood were obtained prior to training (PRE) and at
               the 3-week (W3) and 6-week time points (W6). The 10 lowest (LOW)
               and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered
               based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in
               right leg VL mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), VL
               thickness assessed via ultrasound, upper right leg lean soft
               tissue mass assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and
               mid-thigh circumference. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare
               biomarker differences between the LOW and HIGH clusters over
               time, and stepwise linear regression was performed to elucidate
               biomarkers that explained significant variation in the composite
               hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all
               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >
               W3\&W6), pan-mTOR (PRE > W3 W3 W3 W3), muscle ubiquitin-labeled
               proteins (PRE > W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6 > W3\&PRE),
               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2
               = 0.152, $\beta$ = 0.390, p = 0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R 2 =
               0.207, $\beta$ = -0.455, p = 0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6
               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size
               is limited, these data suggest: (a) HIGH responders may exhibit
               more growth potential given that they possessed lower PRE type
               II fCSA values and (b) possessing a greater type II fiber
               percentage as a trained individual may be advantageous for
               hypertrophy in response to resistance training.",

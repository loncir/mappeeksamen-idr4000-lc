  abstract = "This study examined the effects of different volumes of
              resistance training on muscle size and function over a 10-wk
              period. Low volume = 3 sets per muscle group per week; moderate =
              6 sets; high = 12 sets. Twenty-seven men with 1--4 yrs weight
              training experience were randomly assigned to the different
              training volumes and trained 4 days a week. A periodized routine
              was used; exercises, training intensity, and number of training
              days were the same for each group. The only variation between
              conditions was the number of sets per exercise. Pre and post
              measurements assessed muscular size via ultrasound; strength via
              maximum squat and bench press; and power via vertical jump and
              bench press throw. Urinary concentrations of test-osterone and
              cortisol were also analyzed to assess the responses to training
              conditions. All 3 training volumes significantly (p < 0.05)
              increased muscle size, strength, and upper body power, with no
              significant between-group differences. There were no significant
              changes in hormonal concentrations. The results support the use
              of low volume training for muscular development over a 10-wk

               torque, normalized maximal bilateral leg extension strength,
               normalized maximal isometric torque, and muscle recruitment of
               the right knee extensors in previously untrained young (23.8

               (67.6 $\pm$ 6.3 years, range 60-78 years; n = 15). Participants
               performed either one set or three sets of 10 repetitions for the
               bilateral leg extension and bilateral leg curl at an intensity
               of 50-75\% of maximal strength 3 days per week for 10 weeks.
               Main effects were observed over time for all variables (P 0.05).
               Our results provide a novel contribution to the literature
               demonstrating that additional neuromuscular adaptation during
               early-phase moderate-intensity resistance training in previously
               untrained young and older women may not be elicited through
               higher-volume training when training loads are matched provided
               that a minimal volume threshold is attained. These findings may
               have practical applications for the prescription of
               short-duration resistance training programmes to enhance muscle
               strength and achieve hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic
               adaptations in untrained women.",

## Methods

### Participants

The study included 34 participants between the ages of 18 and 40. To be eligible for the study one had to meat specific health criteria and be a non-smoker. People were excluded if they had any sensitivity to local anesthetics, had participated in resistance training more than once a week in the previous year, had limitations in muscle strength due to injury, or were taking medications that could interfere with training outcomes[@hammarstrÃ¶m2020]. Participants are further described in @tbl-participants. Overall, the male participants are older, taller and heavier than the female participants.

@tbl-change-leanmass shows the average lean body mass changes from pre- to post-intervention in male and females. The average change for the single set condition were lower compared to the multiple set condition for both sexes, indicating that multiple sets results in a greater lean mass gain. The last column (Mean difference) indicates that the males had a higher increase of lean mass compared to the female participants.
